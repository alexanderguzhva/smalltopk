# smalltopk

Smalltopk library is designed to speed up the training for `Product Quantization` and `Product Residual Quantization`. An [long article](article/main5.md) about the library is available.

This library was written specifically for the Milvus project (https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus) and is planned to be part of it.

This is an early alpha version for both the code and [the article](article/main5.md).

Tested on:
* Intel Xeon 4-th gen (Sapphire Rapids 8488C)
* AMD Zen 4 (9R14)
* AWS Graviton 3
